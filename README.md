# MSP430FR2355_IoT_IR_car

From North Carolina State University's ECE 306 Embedded Systems course.

The project is an MCU controlled wifi enabled car that can detect and follow black lines on the ground and recieved commands via telnet web app.

initial push occured part way through course when I realized I needed a better system for tracking changes.
Push one contains first implementation of interrupts and timers, and motor control functionality.
